### My final project for a mathematical modeling course in bioinformatics

This is an example of some work that I have done utilizing R and Bioconductor. 
My aim was to compare gene expression between breast and ovarian cancer cells, 
as well as compare these to a "control" cancer cell type.
Here I also demonstrate the creation of heatmaps and data vis in R.
This was a class within my master's program at Brandeis University.
